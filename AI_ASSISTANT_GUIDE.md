User: "Call it 'Enterprise Outreach 2024' and the purpose is to book demos with VP+ at tech companies"

AI: "Great! Now let's define the steps. What kind of touches do you want? For example: Day 1 - Email, Day 3 - Call, Day 5 - LinkedIn, etc."

User: "Day 1 email, Day 2 call, Day 4 email, Day 7 LinkedIn message, Day 10 final email"

AI: "Perfect! I've prepared a 5-step cadence called 'Enterprise Outreach 2024'. Ready to create it?"
